# these secrets currently specified in bootstrap.yaml config as gitignored references
# in format:
#
#  - name: jenkins-casc
#    version: 0.1.0
#    repo: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-watchmen/helm-charts/helm-repo/
#    secrets:
#      - key: secrets.GHE_HEH_SID_TOKEN
#
# and the value of GHE_HEH_SID_TOKEN will get grabbed from a local gitignored file
# and set on "helm upgrade" cli call as "--set" args...
#
# note: alternative to jenkins-casc secret mechanism would be to use bootstrap secret feature directly,
# but would get into ugly deep set notation:
#
# e.g. configuration.jenkins.credentials.system.domainCredentials[0].credentials[0].usernamePassword.password
#
# so not too pretty, but noting here for future reference...
#
# below is what the yaml would look like, if we weren't using bootstrap's secret mechanism.
# something like below might literally be placed here if we were using something like git-crypt...
#
#secrets:
#  GHE_HEH_SID_TOKEN: super-secret
